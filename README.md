Heart attack recovery at Care and Cure Hospital involves a structured plan that focuses on medical treatment, lifestyle changes, and emotional well-being. Post-heart attack care includes medications to improve heart function, regular monitoring, and supervised physical activity to rebuild strength. The hospital offers personalized diet plans, stress management techniques, and cardiac rehabilitation programs to help patients regain confidence in their daily lives. Prevention is equally important; patients are educated on controlling risk factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. Regular checkups, ECG monitoring, and guidance from cardiologists ensure early detection of potential issues. Emotional support through counseling helps patients overcome anxiety and adapt to a healthier lifestyle. With its experienced cardiology team and holistic approach, Care and Cure Hospital empowers patients to recover faster and significantly reduce the risk of future cardiac events.
